	'description', '[b]Currently Known Issues[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There can be bugs if the games language is changed. I am not sure if your game has to be on "AUTO" or in english. Still investigating.\n[*]If there is a militia squad at E9 or a militia squad moves to E9 at a certain event it will vanish. It does not break the event as I thought earlier it is just that the event is somehow broken as it only triggers if you defeat everyone at E9\n[*]You can deactivate the mod and your savegame will still work but there is no real uninstall at the moment. I am working on it.\n[*]Please make a backup savegame before activating this mod. Close and restart the game after activation.\n[/list]\n\nCurrent Version: 2.0\n\n(From now on Version numbers will follow the games Version numbering. so 1.2 is 2.0 and after 1.3 will be released I will switch the mod to 3.0)\n\n[b]Overview[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Militia online hub with webshop\n[*]Militia squads can be moved\n[*]Militia squads can be managed through squad management\n[*]Militia squads can be renamed\n[*]Militia soldiers have names, a hometown and a background story (thanks ChatGPT)\n[*]Militia soldiers have randomized stats and professions\n[*]Especially rookies but on veterans have worse morale when fighting away from home\n[*]The mod changes the default squad size to 8\n[*]Optional default - In combat, militia soldiers can be controlled by the player (auto-resolve is still possible)\n[*]Optional default - Militia soldiers must be equipped with weapons and other stuff\n[*]Optional default - Militia soldiers have to be paid continuously (additional costs when they are on campaign)\n[*]Optional default - Cities lose loyalty when too few soldiers (including mercenaries) are stationed\n[/list]\n\n[b]Compatibility with other mods[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]This mod changes some core functions, but it should not collide with popular mods in general\n[*]Tested with “Custom Settings” squad sizes and militia sizes. (The mod by itself increases the squad size to 8 and also the militia squads are designed for this size)\n[*]Audaki’s UI Enhancements morale description is not correct for militia soldiers at the moment.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Plans for the future[/b]\n\nThis mod is intended to be a wip and will be developed further. Feel free to post your suggestions.\n\n[list]\n[*]Militia specific operations\n[*]Revision of militia training (By default militia soldiers can’t generate XP and are randomized)\n[*]City Loyalty will influence militia availablity\n[*]Individual Loyalty\n[*]Perks for militia soldiers\n[*]…\n[/list]\n\nTrello: https://trello.com/b/GKYG4MlF/grand-chien-militia\n\n[b]Thank you modding Discord and Haemimont![/b]\n\nWithout the community in the modding Discord and also the support of the developers, this mod would not have been possible. In particular, I would like to thank Audaki, Anarkythera, Tobias, SkunkXL and HG_Feanor for their help.\n\n[b]Credits[/b]\n\nIcon with the house was downloaded from flaticon.com and created by “Freepik\nIcon with the dog was also downloaded from flaticon.com and created by “Vitaly Gorbachev”.\nMilitia bios, names and squad-names were created with ChatGPT and Bard',
