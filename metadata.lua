	'description', "Tested with 1.3\nCurrent Version: 3.12\n\nImportant Change in 3.12\n\nThe militia shop is using Bobby Ray's item configuration from now on. This means that prices, availablity and other things are similiar to Bobby Ray's. The best thing is that there are no longer any submods needed to add items from other mods to the militia shop.\n\nNew 3.10 feature:\n\nCollect and Transfer Operation, Collect items from a city, transfer them to a different sector of sell them to Arulco.\n\nNew 3.4 feature:\n\nCapture POWs and interrogate them. Watch video for more details.\n\nNew 3.0 features:\n\nThere is a new operation \"Build militia base\" which\n\n[list]\n[*]Is a supply hub for your militia (Lower upkeep costs)\n[*]Lowers training costs\n[*]Enables two new operations described below\n[/list]\n\nFrom now on militia does not spawn from thin air but has to be recruited from a limited pool. Loyalty and a militia popularity factor are cruical to find new recruits.\n\nHow to gain and loose Popularity\n[list]\n[*]You will lose 1% popularity each day.\n[*]If you gain loyalty in the city you also gain popularity\n[*]Globally winning battles will increse poularity (Losing will decrease popularity)\n[*]Loyalty influences the number of available recruits\n[*]There is a new operation \"Recruitment drive\" wich will increase popularity (and give instantly new recruits based on Leadership)\n[*](If a militia unit dies you will lose popularity in it's hometown <- does not work at the moment)\n[/list]\n\nChanges to Loyalty:\n[list]\n[*]You now longer lose loyalty if there are not enough militia soldiers if your loyalty is below 30%\n[*]You will gain loyalty if you train militia\n[*]Loyalty influences the number of available recruits\n[*]There is a new operation \"Humanitarian aid\" which will increase loyality\n[/list]\n\n[b]Currently Known Issues[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Testing with 1.3 was limited, so it is possible that there are new unknown bugs\n[*]There can be bugs if the games language is changed. I am not sure if your game has to be on \"AUTO\" or in english. Still investigating.\n[*]If there is a militia squad at E9 or a militia squad moves to E9 at a certain event it will vanish. It does not break the event as I thought earlier it is just that the event is somehow broken as it only triggers if you defeat everyone at E9\n[*]You can deactivate the mod and your savegame will still work but there is no real uninstall at the moment. I am working on it.\n[*]Please make a backup savegame before activating this mod. Close and restart the game after activation.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Overview[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Militia online hub with webshop\n[*]Militia base building \n[*]New operations\n[*]Changes to militia training\n[*]Enemies can be captured and interrogated\n[*]New logistic operation to transfer or sell items\n[*]Militia squads can be moved\n[*]Militia squads can be managed through squad management\n[*]Militia squads can be renamed\n[*]Militia soldiers have names, a hometown and a background story (thanks ChatGPT)\n[*]Militia soldiers have randomized stats and professions\n[*]Especially rookies but on veterans have worse morale when fighting away from home\n[*]The mod changes the default squad size to 8\n[*]Optional default - In combat, militia soldiers can be controlled by the player (auto-resolve is still possible)\n[*]Optional default - Militia soldiers must be equipped with weapons and other stuff\n[*]Optional default - Militia soldiers have to be paid continuously (additional costs when they are on campaign)\n[*]Optional default - Cities lose loyalty when too few soldiers (including mercenaries) are stationed\n[/list]\n\n[b]Compatibility with other mods[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]This mod changes some core functions, but it should not collide with popular mods in general\n[*]Tested with “Custom Settings” squad sizes and militia sizes. (The mod by itself increases the squad size to 8 and also the militia squads are designed for this size)\n[*]Audaki’s UI Enhancements morale description is not correct for militia soldiers at the moment.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Plans for the future[/b]\n\nThis mod is intended to be a wip and will be developed further. Feel free to post your suggestions.\n\n[list]\n[*]Capturing enemy soldiers as POWs\n[*]Revision of militia training (By default militia soldiers can’t generate XP and are randomized)\n[*]Individual Loyalty\n[*]Perks for militia soldiers\n[*]…\n[/list]\n\nTrello: https://trello.com/b/GKYG4MlF/grand-chien-militia\n\n[b]Thank you modding Discord and Haemimont![/b]\n\nWithout the community in the modding Discord and also the support of the developers, this mod would not have been possible. In particular, I would like to thank Audaki, Anarkythera, Tobias, SkunkXL and HG_Feanor for their help.\n\n[b]Credits[/b]\n\nIcon with the house was downloaded from flaticon.com and created by “Freepik\nIcon with the dog was also downloaded from flaticon.com and created by “Vitaly Gorbachev”.\nMilitia bios, names and squad-names were created with ChatGPT and Bard",
